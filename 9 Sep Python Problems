1.	Letâ€™s say you are making n chocolate piles in a row. The first pile has n chocolates. The number of chocolates in each pile
depends on the first pile. If the first pile has an even number of chocolates, then all piles must have an even number of chocolates. 
Similarly, if the first pile has an odd number of chocolates, then all piles must have an odd number of chocolates. Each pile must 
have more chocolates than the previous pile, but as few as possible. Write a Python program to print the number of chocolates in each pile.

2.	Write a program to find a list of integers containing exactly five distinct values, such that no integer repeats consecutively. 
Example:
Input:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output:
True
Input:
[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4,  5]
Output:
False
Input:
[1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
Output:
False

3.	Write a Python program to print the indexes of numbers in a given list that are below a given threshold. 
Example:
Input: 
[0, 12, 45, 3, 4923, 322, 105, 29, 15, 39, 55], 100
Output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Input:
[0, 12, 4, 3, 49, 9, 1, 5, 3], 10
Output:
[0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]

4.	Write a Python program to check whether the given strings are palindromes or not. Return True otherwise False.
Input:
['palindrome', 'madamimadam', '', 'foo', 'eyes']
Output:
[False, True, True, False, False]

5.	Write a Python program to find the length of a given list of non-empty strings. For example:
Input:
['cat', 'car', 'fear', 'center']
Output:
[3, 3, 4, 6]
Input:
['cat', 'dog', 'shatter', 'donut', 'at', 'todo', '']
Output:
[3, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 0]
